        <h2>Seijuro Akashi</h2>
        <p>
          Seijūrō Akashi (赤司 征十郎 Akashi Seijūrō) was the captain of Generation of Miracles. He is the only person that the Generation of Miracles knuckles under. He is the point guard and captain of Rakuzan High and later on for Team Vorpal Swords as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Akashi when first appearing in the series is shown with an extremely intimidating and condescending personality. He is able to control the Generation of Miracles as their leader as they all submit to his requests. Akashi has a certain level of respect for all of his teammates, former and present, and has utter faith in their abilities. Due to the way Akashi grew up during childhood, he developed a strong winners-mentality, believing that winners get everything in life while losers are denied all.
